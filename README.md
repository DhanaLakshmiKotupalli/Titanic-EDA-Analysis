# 🚢 Titanic EDA Analysis

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand key factors that influenced passenger survival. It uses various Python data analysis and visualization tools to extract insights and present findings through graphs and observations.

---

## 📊 Objective

- Explore the Titanic dataset to identify trends, patterns, and relationships among features.
- Analyze survival rate by gender, class, age, and fare.
- Visualize the data using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- Summarize findings in a report for future predictive modeling.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- Format: CSV (train.csv)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

---

## 🔍 Key Steps in EDA

1. Data loading and cleaning
2. Univariate analysis (Age, Sex, Class, Fare)
3. Bivariate analysis (Survival by Gender, Class, Age)
4. Correlation heatmap
5. Pair plots and box plots
6. Summary of insights

---

## 📈 Sample Visualizations

- Countplot of Survived vs Gender
- Boxplot of Age vs Survival
- Heatmap of feature correlations
- Histogram of Age distribution

---

## 📄 Deliverables

- `Titanic_EDA.ipynb`: Clean and well-commented notebook
- `Titanic_EDA_Report.pdf`: Summary report with visuals and key findings

---

## ✅ Summary of Findings

- Females had a higher chance of survival.
- Passengers in 1st class were more likely to survive.
- Younger and higher-paying passengers had better survival odds.
- Gender, Pclass, Age, and Fare are key predictors.
